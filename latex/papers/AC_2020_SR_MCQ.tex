\question
	Which of the following is the best approximate ratio of the brightness of a magnitude 1 star, to that of a magnitude 3 star?

	\begin{oneparchoices}
		\choice $ 2 $
		\choice $ 4 $
		\correctchoice $\displaystyle \frac{631}{100} $
		\choice $\displaystyle \frac{100}{631} $
		\choice $\displaystyle \frac{89}{5} $
	\end{oneparchoices}
	\begin{solution}
		Repurpose the Luminosity-Absolute Magnitude relationship in the Formula Book, and it follows that the magnitude 1 star is $ 10^{\frac{3-1}{2.5}} \approx 6.31 $ times as bright as the magnitude 3 star. Hence the nearest ratio is $  \frac{631}{100}$.
	\end{solution}

\question
	A rule of thumb is that it is best to stargaze during a new moon, rather than during a full moon. Why?
	\begin{choices}
		\choice The Moon will pass in front of several objects in the sky.
		\choice Celestial objects only align with their charted positions, under a new moon.
		\choice Telescopes \textbf{only} function under a new moon, and \textbf{never} under a full moon.
		\correctchoice The glare of the Moon washes out the fainter objects in the sky.
		\choice \textbf{All} celestial objects are only visible in the sky under a new moon.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		The Moon is the brightest object in the night sky. The glare of the Moon will wash out any dimmer deep sky objects, magnified or otherwise.

\question
	During an astronomy outreach event, a member of the public asked, `How would you visually tell a star apart from a planet?' Which of the following would be the best response?
	\begin{choices}
		\choice Planets always appear \textbf{brighter} than stars.
		\correctchoice Stars `twinkle', but planets don't.
		\choice Planets appear significantly \textbf{bigger} than stars to the naked eye.
		\choice Stars are of a different colour compared to the planets.
		\choice Planets are only visible through a telescope.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		Although stars are enormous, they are several orders of magnitude further away from the Earth, than the planets are. Through a telescope, it is clear that the planets are actually \textit{discs}, while stars are \textit{still} apparent \textit{points} of light.

		This means that the refractive and turbulent effect of the atmosphere causes the star's image to change slightly in brightness and position, and hence the `twinkle'. The \textit{apparent} size of the planets in the sky means that this turbulent effect is not pronounced, hence presenting a relatively stable image to the eye.
	\end{solution}

\question
	While Clarence was reading a book on telescopes, he came across a rather interesting-looking equation, which suggested that for a night sky object with a declination of $ \delta $, if an object was to be kept within the field of view (FOV) for a certain amount of time $ t $ seconds, the required FOV (in degrees) would be given by the equation:
	\[ \text{FOV} = kt\cos{\delta}\]
	where $ k $ is some constant to be determined. This is provided that we position the object to one side of the eyepiece (along the edge of the field of view) and turn off the telescope drive.

	Which of the following could be a possible value of the constant $ k $?

	\begin{oneparchoices}
		\choice \num{1.04d-3}
		\choice \num{2.09d-3}
		\correctchoice \num{4.18d-3}
		\choice \num{6.25d-3}
		\choice \num{8.33d-3}
	\end{oneparchoices}
	\begin{solution}
		Since the equation must work for all declination values, we can easily set it to be at $ \delta= \ang{0} $. Hence, these objects will tend to drift across the diameter of the field of view. Thus, to determine the FOV, i.e. the angular displacement, we know that the angle travelled (ie. “FOV”) of $ \ang{360} $ is done through 24 hours (because that is the total angle rotated by the Earth about its own axis).

		Hence, $\text{FOV}=\ang{360}, \, t = \SI{86164}{\second}, \,\delta=\ang{0} $ gives $ k = \num{4.18d-3} $.

		Note that it does not matter if we use a sidereal day or a solar day. The answers will round off to be approximately this value, either way.

\question
	Contrary to what one might expect, the latest sunrise of the year does not occur during the
	respective hemispheres' winter solstices. Why is this so?

	You may assume this location does not lie within equatorial latitudes.

	\begin{choices}
		\choice	The \textbf{Earth} is significantly oblate. This leads to variations in the time of sunrise due to horizon effects.
		\choice	The \textbf{Sun} is significantly oblate. This leads to variations in the time of sunrise as our perspective of the Sun’s shape changes across time.
		\correctchoice	As the Earth’s orbit is elliptical, the Sun appears to drift across the night sky at different rates, over the year.
		\choice	Milankovitch cycles affect the Earth’s axial tilt, causing a large constant drift in sunrise timing.
		\choice	The question statement is false. The latest sunrise of the year \textit{does} in fact occur during the respective hemispheres' winter solstices.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		\circled{A} and \circled{B} are clearly false, and while Milankovitch cycles do affect Earth’s axial tilt, it takes place over long timescales and thus is too small to be easily noticeable.

		\choice	The object has a luminosity distance of \SI{1.2}{\mega\parsec}.
		\choice	The object has a co-moving distance of \SI{1.2}{\mega\parsec}.

\question
	Brian noticed two satellites passing directly overhead in opposite directions. He decided to label the satellite moving from West to East \textbf{A}, and the satellite moving from East to West \textbf{C}. He then noticed the same two satellites passing directly over his head again, exactly 8 hours later.

	Suppose that the satellites are in circular orbits, and that Brian is on the equator. What is the ratio of the orbital radius of satellite \textbf{A} to that of satellite \textbf{C}?

	\begin{oneparchoices}
		\choice	$ 0.481 $
		\correctchoice	$ 0.630 $
		\choice	$ 1 $
		\choice	$ 1.587 $
		\choice	$ 2.080 $
	\end{oneparchoices}
	\begin{solution}
		Note that the Earth rotates prograde---when viewed from above the North pole, it rotates anticlockwise, i.e. from West to East.

		Notice that for satellite A, since it is orbiting in the same direction as the direction of rotation of the Earth, he must have covered an angle equivalent to one entire round, and the angle rotated by the Earth during these 8 hours. Hence, $ \theta_A=\ang{360}+\ang{120}=\ang{480} $ (8 hours amount to $ \ang{120} $)

		A similar logic can be applied to satellite C. However, since it is orbiting in the opposite direction, the total angle covered is one entire round, but with the angle rotated by the Earth during these 8 hours being subtracted off.

		$ \therefore \, \theta_B=\ang{360}-\ang{120}=\ang{240}$.
		Now, these angles are covered in the same amount of time, 8 hours. Hence, we can deduce that the angular velocity of A is twice of C, i.e, $\displaystyle \frac{\omega_C}{\omega_A}=\frac{1}{2} $. This is equivalent to saying that the orbital period of A is half that of C.

		From Kepler’s \nth{3} Law of Planetary Motion, we can obtain the following equation: $ \omega^2=\frac{GM}{r^3} $.

		Hence, $\displaystyle \frac{r_A}{r_C}=\left(\frac{\omega_C}{\omega_A}\right)^\slantfrac{2}{3} $
		Therefore, the required ratio is $\displaystyle (0.5)^\slantfrac{2}{3}=0.630 $.

\question
	Mercury's orbit has a semi-major axis of \SI{0.387}{\AU}. At aphelion, Mercury is \SI{0.467}{\AU} from the Sun; at perihelion, it is \SI{0.307}{\AU} from the Sun.

		\choice $ 0.657 $
		\correctchoice None of the above.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		Trick question. Angular momentum is \textit{always} conserved, so the ratio should be \textbf{1}. Hence none of the options are correct except \circled{E}. Information is given as a red herring.

\question
	Which of the following statements about the celestial sphere is \textbf{false}?

	\begin{choices}
		\choice The angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator is the axial tilt of the Earth.
		\correctchoice An observer stationed at a \textit{fixed} location would observe \textit{exactly} the same night sky every year at the same date and time.
		\choice The rotational axis of the Earth always points at the celestial North and South poles.
		\choice Most of the planets of the solar system lie close to the ecliptic.
		\choice The equatorial coordinate system uses declination and right ascension, the latter being the `longitude' of the object from the March equinox.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		The visible planets all have synodic periods that are significantly different from 1 year.

		Furthermore, due to axial precession, the rotational axis of the Earth changes its orientation, so the night sky changes slowly with a period of \num{26000} years. The rest of the options are self-explanatory.

\question
	If the escape velocity of an object of one solar mass exceeded the speed of light, what would be its radius?

		\correctchoice \SI{2950}{\metre}
		\choice \SI{4.43e13}{\metre}
		\choice \SI{1476}{\metre}
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		This question is essentially asking what would be the radius of the Sun, if it were to become a black hole (i.e. its Schwarzschild radius). Hence options \circled{A}, \circled{B} and \circled{D} can be eliminated immediately, as these values are far too large.

		Thence, it is a straightforward matter of plugging numbers into the formula:
		\begin{flalign*}
		r_s &= \frac{2GM_{\astrosun}}{c^2} &\\
		&= \frac{2\left(\SI{6.67384e-11}{\newton\metre\squared\per\kg\squared}\right)\left(\SI{1.989e30}{\kg}\right)}{\left(\SI{2.99792458e8}{\metre\per\second}\right)^2} &\\

		\choice \num{1.16}
		\correctchoice \num{1.35}
		\choice \num{3.63}
	\end{oneparchoices}
	\begin{solution}
		Kepler's \nth{2} Law states that the \textbf{linear} velocity ratio at perihelion to aphelion is inversely proportional to distance---in other words, angular momentum is conserved.

		On the other hand, \textbf{angular} velocity is \textit{inversely} proportional to $ r^2 $. The ratio of distance is $ \frac{1+e}{1-e} $. \circled{B} is a red herring for those who confuse angular momentum with angular velocity.

\question
	A planet with a strong magnetic field tends to collect and trap highly energetic and charged particles emitted by the Sun in belts around its equator. Jupiter’s radiation belts are particularly intense, and pose a major radiation hazard to any orbiting spacecraft or human.

	Which of the following methods is \textbf{least effective} in mitigating radiation damage caused by charged particles?
	\begin{choices}
		\choice	Orbiting the planet in an highly elliptical polar orbit.
		\choice	Storing food and water in the walls of the spacecraft.
		\correctchoice	Constructing a Faraday cage of metal wire mesh around the essential parts of the spacecraft.
		\choice	Constructing a lead box around essential parts of the spacecraft.
		\choice	All of the above methods are feasible.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		A Faraday cage would neutralise the electric fields of electromagnetic waves from penetrating the interior, but would not actually stop charged particles, which are highly energetic, and hence have relativistic velocities. Thus, these particles would not be effectively stopped by a Faraday Cage --- shielding is required to slow these particles down to a stop.

		\correctchoice \textbf{III} only
		\choice \textbf{I}, \textbf{II}, and \textbf{III} only
	\end{oneparchoices}
	\begin{solution}
		\textbf{I}: using spherical optical elements will introduce spherical aberration in images. Aspheric optical elements are used instead.

		\textbf{II}: On Earth, a Nasmyth focus is usually used for observatories as light is directed outwards along the altitude axis. This allows heavy instruments (e.g. spectrometers) to be used without moving along with the telescope and straining the bearings of the observatory. In space, however, the scope can move freely in zero-gravity, allowing heavy equipment to be installed directly at the Cassegrain focus and hence Cassegrain design is more commonly used.

		\textbf{III}: Reflectors are indeed more popular in the recent century as they grant greater focal length, and have less glass to be ground (1 mirror surface compared to 2 on refractors), which makes reflector telescopes relatively cheaper as aperture size increases.

	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		The two major components are \textbf{II} and \textbf{III}. The analemma is a reflection of the extent of difference of the hour angle between the mean Sun and real Sun across a year.

		The orbital eccentricity of the Earth causes the angular velocity of the real Sun on the ecliptic to vary along its orbit, thus the real Sun appears to lag behind or speed ahead of the mean Sun across a year.

		As Earth’s axial tilt is non-zero, the projection vector of the real Sun onto the celestial equator (the angular velocity in right ascension) does not have constant magnitude. This introduces another deviation in the RA of the real Sun from the mean Sun.

		\textbf{I} and \textbf{IV} are \textbf{incorrect} since they are intrinsic factors of the Earth that do not affect the angular velocity (or its components) of the Sun along the ecliptic.

		\item   The complete analemma may be photographed \textbf{anywhere} on Earth.

		\choice	\textbf{I} and \textbf{II}
		\choice	\textbf{II} and \textbf{III}
		\choice	\textbf{II} and \textbf{IV}
		\correctchoice	None of the above options are correct.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		\textbf{I} is false. To photograph the complete analemma, the Sun must culminate above the horizon at local mean noon every day of the year. This is not true, say, for locations near the Earth’s geographic poles, which experience polar nights when the Sun does not rise above the horizon at all in a given day.

		\textbf{II} is false. Local apparent noon occurs when the apparent solar time (time told by a sundial) indicates the Sun has culminated on the local meridian. If the Sun is photographed exactly at local apparent noon everyday, the composed image will trace out a line segment along the meridian and not the analemma.

		\textbf{III} is false. The analemma is asymmetrical in shape (if you have seen photos). The physical reason for this is that the two components of the analemma (orbital eccentricity and axial tilt) are phase-shifted, hence the resultant sinusoidal wave does not have constant amplitude.

		\textbf{IV} is true. The long axis of the analemma always lies along the local meridian as these are the locations where the mean Sun and apparent real Sun coincide in a year. The projection of the analemma (from the real Sun) onto the local meridian traces out the culmination of the mean Sun across the year.

\question
	The hyperbolic excess velocity, $ v_\infty $, is defined as the velocity attained by a spacecraft as the spacecraft approaches infinity. The velocity at any given distance $ r $ from a gravitating body is given by $ v $ and the escape velocity from the gravitating body is $ v_e $.

	Which of the following expressions used to calculate the hyperbolic excess velocity of a gravitating body $ v_\infty $ is \textbf{correct}?
	\begin{choices}
		\choice $ v_\infty=v+v_e $
		\choice $ {v_\infty}^2=v^2+{v_e}^2 $
		\correctchoice $ v_\infty=\ \sqrt{(v-v_e)(v+v_e)} $
		\choice $\displaystyle {v_\infty}^2=v^2+\frac{{v_e}^2}{4} $
		\choice $\displaystyle v_\infty=\ \sqrt{\left(v-\frac{v_e}{2}\right)\left(v+\frac{v_e}{2}\right)} $
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		We can solve this by looking at the definitions involved.

		TE = KE(excess)

		TE = KE(excess) + escape velocity KE – GPE at the point

		By definition, a body at escape velocity has enough KE to overcome gravity, thus both terms sum to 0. We now recall that by energy conservation, TE is also given by current KE – current GPE, yielding:

		Current KE – GPE at the point = KE(excess) + escape velocity KE – GPE at the point

		Current KE = KE(excess) + escape velocity KE

		Dividing throughout yields:
		\begin{flalign*}
			v^2 &= {v_e}^2+{v_\infty}^2 &\\
			{v_\infty}^2 &=v^2-{v_e}^2=(v_e+v)(v-v_e)
		\end{flalign*}
		Square-rooting yields the desired answer.

	Manhattanhenge is an event during which the setting sun or the rising sun is aligned with the main street grid of Manhattan, New York City. It is known that Manhattanhenge sunsets occur in pairs annually.

		Manhattanhenge occurs twice a year because on those dates, the sunset’s azimuth aligns with the direction of the street. This implies that Manhattenhenge sunsets are equally spaced around the summer solstice, and that the other Manhattenhenge sunset must happen \textbf{after} the summer solstice.

		Given that the summer solstice typically falls on 21 June, and 30 May is 20 days earlier, it follows that the next date is roughly 20 days after 21 June, which is 12th July.

\question
	Being an inquisitive astronomer, Keven wants to determine the \textbf{speed} of a star that is moving away from Earth, with respect to an observer from the Earth (i.e himself).

	Keven is provided with the following information:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
		\item The spectral line of iron from the star at $ \lambda_\text{rest} $ (wavelength recorded with respect to the frame of the star) is redshifted by a magnitude $ \Delta\lambda $.

		We can assume that $ \Delta\lambda \ll \lambda_\text{rest} $. The wavelengths are all recorded in metres.
		\item The proper motion is $ \mu $, recorded in arc seconds per year.
		\item The parallax of the star is given by $ p $, recorded in arc-seconds. We can assume that $ p $ is small enough such that $ \sin{p} \approx p $.
	\end{itemize}
	Which of the following expressions best represents the expression that Keven should use to determine the speed of the star relative to him, in \si{\km\per\s}?

	Hint: To ease your calculation, note that $\displaystyle \frac{\SI{1}{\AU}}{\SI{1}{\year}} $ is approximately \SI{4.74}{\km\per\s}.
	\begin{choices}
		\choice $\displaystyle \sqrt{\left(\frac{c\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_\text{rest} + \Delta\lambda}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4740p}{\mu}\right)^2}$

		\choice $\displaystyle \sqrt{\left[\frac{c\Delta\lambda}{1000\left(\lambda_\text{rest} + \Delta\lambda\right)}\right]^2 + \left(\frac{4740\mu}{p}\right)^2}$
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		Recall that for relativistic redshift, $\displaystyle z=\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_\text{rest}} = \frac{v_r}{c} $,  where $ v_r $ represents radial velocity.

		Hence, it follows that $\displaystyle v_r = \frac{c\Delta\lambda}{\lambda\text{rest}}\si{\m\per\s}= \frac{c\Delta\lambda}{1000\lambda_\text{rest}} \si{\km\per\s} $ for the radial component of the velocity of the star.

		Next, for a given parallax angle, we know that $\displaystyle \tan{p} \approx p = \frac{\SI{1}{\AU}}{r} \implies r = \frac{\SI{1}{\AU}}{p} $

		Furthermore, the tangential velocity is given by $\displaystyle v_\theta = r\mu = \SI{1}{\AU} \times \frac{p}{\mu} = \frac{4.74p}{\mu}\si{\km\per\s} $

		Hence, the speed is given by $\displaystyle v = \sqrt{v_r^2+v_\theta^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{c\Delta\lambda}{1000\lambda_\text{rest}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4.74p}{\mu}\right)^2} $.

		Maths isn’t actually needed to solve this question. Recall that for main-sequence stars, luminosity steadily increases with temperature. Thus we can straight away rule out that $ X $ is a main-sequence star: no main-sequence star can be both hotter yet less luminous than our sun. Similarly, the extreme luminosity for $ Y $ suggests it must either be a massive OB main-sequence star, or a supergiant. OB stars have much higher surface temperatures than \SI{8000}{\K}, ruling them out as a possibility.

	\begin{choices}

	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		Recall from Kepler’s 3rd Law of Planetary Motion that $\displaystyle T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{GM}} $.
		Thus, the total time taken can be split into two components, time taken to go from position \circled{1} to \circled{2}, labelled as $ t_1 $, and time taken to go from position \circled{2} to \circled{3}, labelled as $ t_2 $. These are also half of the period of orbit for each of the ellipses. Hence, $\displaystyle t = \pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}{GM}} $.

		Now, what is left is to determine exactly the semi-major axis of each ellipse.

		Notice that from \circled{1} to \circled{2}, the total distance is $ r_1 + r_3 $. Hence, the semi-major axis for the first ellipse is $ \frac{r_1+r_3}{2} $. Hence, $\displaystyle t_{1} = \pi\sqrt{\frac{\left(r_1+r_3\right)^3}{8GM}} $.

		Similarly, from 2 to 3, the total distance is $ r_2 + r_3 $. Hence, the semimajor axis for the second ellipse is $\displaystyle \frac{r_2 + r_3}{2} $. Hence,
		$\displaystyle t_2 = \pi\sqrt{\frac{\left(r_2+r_3\right)^3}{8GM}} $.

		Thus, the required expression is $\displaystyle t = t_1+t_2=
		\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2GM}}\left[ \left(r_1+r_2\right)^\frac{3}{2}+\left(r_1+r_3\right)^\frac{3}{2}\right] $

	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		Recall from the vis-viva equation, that $\displaystyle v^2=GM\left(\frac{2}{r}-\frac{1}{a}\right) $. Hence, what we need to determine is the velocity before and after the 2nd retrograde burn.

		Note that such a quantity is non-zero, since it is a burn. Despite the spacecraft being at the same position $ r $, the orbital semi-major axis is now different, hence causing a difference in the $ \Delta v $ quantity. Note that $ a_i $ and $ a_f $ which refers to the semimajor axes of the initial and final ellipse are already calculated in 3.
		\begin{flalign*}
		v_i &= \sqrt{GM\left(\frac{2}{r_3}-\frac{1}{a_i}\right)} &\\
			&= \sqrt{GM\left(\frac{2}{r_3}-\frac{2}{r_1+r_3}\right)} &\\
			&= \sqrt{\frac{2GM\left(r_1\right)}{r_3\left(r_1+r_3\right)}}
		\end{flalign*}

		and
		\begin{flalign*}
			v_f &= \sqrt{GM\left(\frac{2}{r_3}-\frac{1}{a_f}\right)} &\\
			 	&= \sqrt{GM\left(\frac{2}{r_3}-\frac{2}{r_2+r_3}\right)} &\\
			 	&=\sqrt{\frac{2GM\left(r_2\right)}{r_3\left(r_2+r_3\right)}}
		\end{flalign*}

		Henceforth,
		\begin{flalign*}
		\Delta v &= \sqrt{\frac{2GM(r_{2})}{r_3}} - \sqrt{\frac{2GM(r_1)}{r_3(r_1 + r_3)}} &\\
		&= \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r_3}}\left(\sqrt{\frac{r_2}{r_2 + r_3}} - \sqrt{\frac{r_1}{r_1 + r_3}}\right)
		\end{flalign*}

		Note that $\displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{r_2}{r_2+r_3}} - \sqrt{\frac{r_1}{r_1+r_3}} > 0 $ since $ r_2 > r_1 $ and we already demanded that $ \Delta v $ is a non-negative quantity (since it is the difference between two quantities).

\question
	According to the formula booklet, the formula for the Jeans length is
	\begin{align*}
		R_J = \sqrt{\frac{15k_{B}T}{4 \pi G\langle m\rangle\langle\rho\rangle}}.
	\end{align*}
	Here, the formula assumes that one is dealing with the collapse of a spherical nebula of uniform density.

	Which of the following statements about the Jeans length, $ R_J' $, is true if, instead of a uniform distribution, the mass of the nebula were to be concentrated on the surface of the spherical nebula, i.e. a spherical shell nebula?
	\begin{choices}
		\choice $ R_{J}' > R_J $
		\choice $ R_{J}' = R_J $
		\correctchoice $ R_J' < R_J $
		\choice There is no valid expression for $ R_J'$, since the quantity representing average density, $ \langle\rho\rangle $, is ill-defined.
		\choice The expressions in \circled{A} to \circled{C} are all possible, depending on the dominant element in the nebula.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		To answer this question, we first consider the main criterion for the formation of a star from the collapse of a nebula---gravitational pressure dominates over thermal pressure.
		Instead of looking at the individual pressure terms, we can instead consider the total energy of the system $ E = U + \Omega $, where $ U $ refers to the kinetic energy of the particles in the nebula, and $ \Omega $ refers to the gravitational potential energy of the particles in the nebula.

		$ E < 0 \iff \text{gravitationally bound} \iff \text{collapse} $

		Hence, what we are comparing is just the $ \Omega $ needed to balance $ U $.

		For which the mass is concentrated on the surface, the gravitational potential energy is `higher' (more negative), $ \Omega' < \Omega $. Hence, $ U^\prime > U $. Physically, we need the nebula to contract more to generate greater thermal pressure to work against this higher gravitational potential energy (i.e. for $ U $ to be higher, the radius of the nebula at equilibrium would have to be smaller).  This means that $ R_{J}'< {R}_{J} $.

		\circled{D}: An ill-defined $ \rho $ does not mean that the equation loses its meaning, especially since we are considering $ \langle\rho\rangle $ (average density) instead of $ \rho $. Here, we are simply looking at the nebula's total mass divided by its total volume, which is obviously well-defined.

		\circled{E}: The main element in a nebula is probably the same (hydrogen). Even if two nebulae have different dominant element, we are asking for the expression of Jeans Length for which $ \langle m\rangle $ is kept constant.

		\textbf{NOTE:} For a spherical shell nebula, the expression for Jeans Length is:

		$\displaystyle R_J^\prime = \sqrt{\frac{9k_BT}{8\pi G\langle m\rangle\langle\rho\rangle}} < \sqrt{\frac{15k_BT}{4\pi G\langle m\rangle\langle\rho\rangle}}=R_J $

	The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will observe primarily in infrared (\SI{1.3}{\micro\m}), while the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observes primarily in visible light (\SI{500}{\nano\m}).

		Rayleigh Criterion + small angle approximation yield:

		Clearly, for both telescopes to have the same angular resolution, JWST needs to have a diameter that is $ \frac{1.3}{0.5} = 2.6\times $ larger. Since we want the surface area ratio, squaring 2.6 yields the answer, 6.8.

		\choice For a star to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, the local pressure gradient must equal the local gravitational acceleration multiplied by the local density at all points in the star.
		\choice An object does not need to be undergoing fusion in order to be in hydrostatic equilibrium.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		\circled{A}: Observe that density, radius and mass are all positive: thus $ \dod{P}{r} < 0 $.

		\circled{C}: Plug in density = 0 into the equation to trivially obtain $ \dod{P}{r} = 0 $.

		While it is \textit{likely} that the meteor is associated with the Eta Aquariids, it is also possible that the meteor is a sporadic (i.e. not associated with any meteor shower).

\question
	Compared to the Sun, Betelgeuse has nearly no hydrogen absorption lines. Instead, Betelgeuse displays numerous oxide absorption lines like \ce{TiO}. Why is this the case?
	\begin{choices}
		\correctchoice	Due to the lower surface temperature of Betelgeuse, most hydrogen atoms do not have electrons in the right energy level to absorb/re-emit photons.
		\choice	As Betelgeuse is a highly evolved star, its hydrogen shell has been ejected in the surrounding planetary nebula.
		\choice	Oxide molecules preferentially absorb radiation, thus suppressing the hydrogen absorption line.
		\choice	All hydrogen in Betelguese has been used up in the s-process, creating the raw elements for heavy metal oxides like TiO.
		\choice	Due to the high velocity of Betelgeuse, the hydrogen absorption lines are all Doppler-shifted into oxide absorption lines.
	\end{choices}
	\begin{solution}
		Ans: Betelgeuse is not a planetary nebula and is too massive to form one, so \circled{B} is false. \circled{C} is false as each compound/atom has its own unique set of absorption lines.
